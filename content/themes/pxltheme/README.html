<p>MP Theme is a simple starter theme for WordPress development. It takes care of some of the things you end up doing on each developments of a theme, thus saving a little time here and there.</p>

<p>Below is some basic information about the theme.</p>

<h2 id="templatefiles">Template Files</h2>

<p>The template files in the theme are only starting points and contain little if no markup.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>The theme has the following folder structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assets - this contains all the theme assets including images, CSS, SASS files and javascript files</li>
<li>Page templates - any page templates created should be placed in here to keep things nice and organised</li>
<li>Parts - this folder is for placing calls to <code>get_template_part</code> files. It contains a loops folder for <code>content-{loop}.php</code> files</li>
<li>Inc - this is an includes file for some other functions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scriptsstyles">Scripts &amp; Styles</h2>

<p>The theme has a file named main.js in the <code>assets/js/</code> folder which is were all the theme javascript functionality should be added. This is minified and compressed into the <code>main-min.js</code> file in the same folder. It is this file that is enqueued in the footer of the site. The theme also includes the <code>fitvids</code> library for responsive video which is added to the main.js file when compiled.</p>

<p>The styles are handled with SASS in the <code>assets/scss/</code> folder. The underscore files breakdown the SASS into easily manageable chunks and they are all included in the main <code>style.scss</code> file. This is compiled to <code>assets/css/style.css</code> which is the stylesheet which is enqueued on the front end.</p>

<h2 id="codekit">Codekit</h2>

<p>The theme contains a <code>config.codekit</code> file which means codekit users need not worry about compiling things in the correct place as long as the theme folder itself is added to Codekit on development.</p>
